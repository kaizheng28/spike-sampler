# spike-sampler
Multi-channel spike sampling program. The code is originally designed for CMOD-A7 FPGA. 

# How to load the FPGA program
Open hardware manager in Xilinx Vivado and load spike-sampler.bit to the FPGA. In this case, the FPGA needs to be reprogrammed each time it power cycles. 

Alternatively, create a memory configuration file and load spike-sampler.bin to the FPGA. The program is then loaded into the flash and no longer needs to be loaded every time.

# MATLAB Spike Capturing Program Usage
Once powered on, the FPGA starts sampling the spikes, and when a spike is detected, the FPGA sends the spike channel ID and the timestamp to the host PC through UART. 

The MATLAB program opens a UART port and records the spike information for a certain amount of time. 

The FPGA supports a total of 16 spike channels. However, on the NeuroRadar baseboard, only 12 channels are connected, as shown in the figure below.

In the gesture recognition case study, 3 NeuroRadar channels are employed which corresponds to 6 spike channels. 

In the localization case study, 6 NeuroRadar channels are employed which corresponds to 12 spike channels.
